My journey in computer science began in August 2022 while I was employed as a maintenance supervisor at a chemical facility. Despite my successful career, I felt a strong desire for more and had always been passionate about working with computers. Encouraged by the advancements and achievements made at this company, I decided to pursue a degree in computer science while continuing to work full-time.

As I dived into my studies, I discovered a deep passion for software development that I hadn't fully realized before. This newfound passion led me to take a leap of faith by leaving my company and dedicating myself fully to my education. Despite the challenges, I completed my bachelor’s degree in a remarkably short amount of time.

Throughout my computer science journey, despite the accelerated speed, I’ve continually pushed myself to adapt to new technologies, languages, and frameworks. This is evident in the projects I've undertaken, which showcase my ability to quickly grasp and implement complex concepts.
