My decision to focus on the IT-145 artifact stemmed from my passion for Java and its relevance to my future career aspirations. I aimed to showcase my existing proficiency in Java and explore deeper into related frameworks like Spring Boot, believing this artifact would be a strong representation of my skills in a field I am eager to pursue.

The integration of MongoDB into my Spring Boot application, alongside efficient query implementation and the use of JSON subtypes, illustrates my growing knowledge in backend frameworks and databases, as well as my familiarity with Java. While this project may seem foundational in the grand scheme of things, I view these skills as a steppingstone that gives me an edge as I embark on my future career.

Furthermore, the use of AWS for live hosting, integration of HTTPS for secure data encryption, and implementation of Spring Security with JWT tokens for authentication and authorization highlight my security-focused mindset and software development capabilities.

The transformation of an in-memory application, which previously had no real-world utility as data was erased after each session, into a potentially production-ready backend service capable of securely storing and accessing information represents a significant improvement. Security measures were also greatly enhanced, a clear-cut contrast to its previous minimal implementation.

In enhancing this artifact, I designed and evaluated solutions that addressed the limitations of the original in-memory application. Migrating to MongoDB enabled me to implement efficient querying and organize different types of rescue animals using JSON subtypes. These decisions underscore my ability to balance trade-offs and apply algorithmic principles to real-world problems, as outlined in the course objective related to designing and evaluating computing solutions.

The integration of Spring Boot and MongoDB into the backend service showcases a substantial advancement in my technical skills. This implementation not only provides value by enabling secure storage and retrieval of rescue animal information but also demonstrates my ability to use industry-standard tools and practices to achieve specific goals in the field of computer science, aligning with the course objective of using techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for implementing computer solutions.

Throughout this process, security was a paramount consideration. By incorporating HTTPS for data encryption and employing Spring Security with JWT tokens for authentication and authorization, I proactively mitigated potential threats. This security mindset extended to ensuring proper data sanitization and validation from the frontend to the backend, further bolstering the application's security, as outlined in the course objective related to developing a security mindset in software architecture and designs.
