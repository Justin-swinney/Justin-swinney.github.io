This project represents the culmination of my computer science degree journey, showcasing the knowledge and skills I've acquired along the way. It is a full-stack application developed using Angular for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Additionally, AWS services such as EC2, S3, and CloudFront are utilized to deploy and host the application, ensuring scalability and reliability.

Through this project, I've gained valuable experience in designing and implementing complex software systems, integrating various technologies, and deploying applications in a production environment. Despite the tight timeline of 5 weeks, this project has provided me with invaluable knowledge and skills, contributing significantly to my growth as a software developer.
