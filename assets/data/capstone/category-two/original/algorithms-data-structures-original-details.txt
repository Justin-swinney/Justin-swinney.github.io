This original artifact utilized memory storage and array list data structures to manage individual animal type collections. However, these lists were non-persistent and only existed during the runtime of the program. Additionally, the program implemented a menu-driven control flow, incorporating a while loop and switch statement, to facilitate user actions. These control flow structures can be classified as algorithmic in nature, as they define a sequence of steps to be executed based on user input.
