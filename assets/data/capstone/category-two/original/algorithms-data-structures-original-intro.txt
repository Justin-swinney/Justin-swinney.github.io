The artifact at hand is a critical component of my journey towards full-stack development. Originally conceived as a basic console menu application for in-memory storage, it served as a tool for employees of a theoretical rescue animal company. Its functionalities included tracking rescue animal information, managing new animal intake, and generating lists of animals based on types. This artifact stands as a testament to my growth, created during the early stages of my computer science degree journey, just a year and a half ago. Although the original artifact contains rough edges, it remains a foundational piece for my enhancements and progress in software development.
