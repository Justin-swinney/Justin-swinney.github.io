The artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio due to its comprehensive demonstration of my growth and capabilities as a software developer. It represents my passion for software development and showcases a significant transition from a basic Java console UI to a modern Angular 17.3 / Bootstrap 5.3 frontend UI, highlighting my ability to adapt to new technologies and effectively solve real-world problems. This enhancement displays my proficiency in the Angular and Bootstrap frameworks, as well as my skill in TypeScript and UX/UI design, illustrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional development beyond the scope of my Computer Science courses.

This artifact enhancement seamlessly demonstrates my ability to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. By creating a modern UI for Grazioso Rescue Academy employees, I facilitated, organized decision-making based on the required type of disaster response. Employees can utilize filtering, sorting, and individual checks of training status to ensure the selection of an appropriate animal for emergency response, all while ensuring the code is well-documented for easy understanding by other developers.

In addition, the enhancement exemplifies my proficiency in designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. The logic behind the UI components incorporates these principles to validate, sanitize, and save data in a format suitable for the backend. This includes error handling, validation, and sanitization to ensure data integrity and security.

Additionally, the project demonstrates my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. The front-end UI implementation connects all components of the full-stack application, delivering industry-specific goals and meeting the requirements of the original IT-145 artifact. This showcases my ability to leverage the Angular framework to communicate through various components and services to deliver content efficiently to users.

Lastly, the enhancement reflects my commitment to developing with security in mind. The implementation of HTTPS protocol and input validation/sanitization in the frontend UI demonstrates my ability to anticipate adversarial exploits in software architecture and design, ensuring privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
