This enhancement project is centered around the transformation of the original Java console UI into a modern Angular 17.3 / Bootstrap 5.3 frontend UI. The primary focus is on enhancing user experience and functionality, favoring real-world scenario functionality over a traditional console menu UI. The new UI includes advanced features such as dynamic searching, filtering, and sorting capabilities, seamless navigation, smooth pagination, and robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT tokens sent from the backend services. Additionally, this enhancement is hosted using AWS S3 for storage, CloudFront for content delivery, and Route53 for DNS management, ensuring reliable and scalable hosting infrastructure. This enhancement aims to elevate the user interface and overall usability of the application, providing a more intuitive and efficient experience for users.
